## App Store Update (v2.1.0)

Over the past month, I have been improving Cat Scratches in many small but important ways.

I use it daily to save articles for later, send clean text to Drafts for AI actions, and capture readable content from cluttered pages.

Version 2.1.0 is now available in the App Store:
[Cat Scratches on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cat-scratches/id6749605278)

The macOS extension is still here, and its update should be approved soon:
[Cat Scratches for macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cat-scratches/id6749605278)

New in this update: Advanced settings now include a Drafts URL Scheme toggle (`Create URL` or `Action URL`) plus a Drafts action field, so you can run post-processing actions from Drafts.

One useful feature: if a page is not parsing correctly, enter its URL under the Advanced tab to get new parsing suggestions.
