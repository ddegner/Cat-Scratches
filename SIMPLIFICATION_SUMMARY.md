# SafariToDrafts Simplification Summary

## Overview
Successfully simplified the SafariToDrafts extension by consolidating individual removal settings into a single "Elements to Remove" list. This eliminates redundancy while maintaining all functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Individual Removal Settings
- **Removed from `settings.js`:**
  - `removeImages: true`
  - `removeAds: true` 
  - `removeNavigation: true`
  - `removeComments: true`
  - `removeRelated: true`

### 2. Updated UI (`settings.html`)
- **Removed checkboxes:**
  - "Remove images and media"
  - "Remove ads and navigation" 
  - "Remove comments and social sharing"
- **Added helpful text:** Explains that all removal settings are now consolidated in the "Elements to Remove" list
- **Updated default textarea content:** Added image and media selectors to the default "Elements to Remove" list

### 3. Simplified Background Logic (`background.js`)
- **Consolidated TurndownService rules:** Removed separate image removal rule, now uses `customFilters` for all removal logic
- **Simplified filter function:** Uses single `customFilters` array instead of multiple hardcoded selector lists
- **Updated fallback logic:** Uses `customFilters` for element removal in fallback scenarios

### 4. Enhanced Default Filters (`settings.js`)
- **Added image and media selectors** to the default `customFilters` array:
  ```javascript
  'img', 'picture', 'figure', 'figcaption', 'video', 'audio', 'source',
  '.image', '.img', '.photo', '.picture', '.gallery', '.slideshow', '.carousel',
  '.lightbox', '.media', '.caption', '.image-caption', '.photo-caption',
  '.media-caption', '.image-credit', '.photo-credit', '.media-credit',
  '.image-container', '.photo-container', '.media-container'
  ```

### 5. Cleaned Up Event Listeners
- **Removed references** to non-existent checkboxes in `settings.js`
- **Simplified UI update functions** to remove individual removal setting handling
