**Effective Date:** August 1, 2025

## Overview

SafariToDrafts ("we," "our," or "the app") is a Safari extension that allows users to capture web content and send it directly to the Drafts app. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our Safari extension.

## Information We Do Not Collect

SafariToDrafts is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be completely transparent about what we do and do not collect:

### No Personal Data Collection
- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- We do not collect your name, email address, or any identifying information
- We do not track your browsing history or website visits
- We do not collect information about which websites you capture content from

### No Content Storage
- We do not store or retain any content you capture from websites
- All captured content is processed locally on your device and sent directly to the Drafts app
- We never see, store, or have access to the content you capture

### No Analytics or Tracking
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not track how you use the extension
- We do not collect usage statistics or performance data
- We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies

### No Network Communication
- The extension does not communicate with our servers
- All processing happens locally on your Mac
- Content is transferred directly from Safari to the Drafts app using local system APIs

## How the Extension Works

SafariToDrafts operates entirely on your local device:

1. **Content Processing**: When you use the extension, it processes the webpage content locally in Safari
2. **Local Conversion**: The content is converted to Markdown format using local JavaScript libraries
3. **Direct Transfer**: The formatted content is sent directly to the Drafts app using macOS URL schemes
4. **No External Communication**: No data leaves your device except to go to the Drafts app

## Permissions We Request

The extension requests the following permissions, which are used solely for its core functionality:

- **Active Tab Access**: To read content from the currently active webpage
- **Scripting Permission**: To execute the content capture and formatting scripts
- **Storage Permission**: To save your extension settings and preferences locally on your device

These permissions are used exclusively to provide the extension's functionality and are not used to collect or transmit data.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there is no data to secure on our end. However:

- All extension processing occurs locally on your device
- Your captured content is handled according to the Drafts app's privacy policy once transferred
- We recommend keeping your macOS and Safari updated for optimal security

## Third-Party Services

SafariToDrafts integrates with:

- **Drafts App**: Content captured by our extension is sent to the Drafts app. Please refer to [Drafts' privacy policy](https://getdrafts.com/privacy/) for information about how they handle your data.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party applications.

## Children's Privacy

SafariToDrafts does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The extension is safe for users of all ages.
